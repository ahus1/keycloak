= Transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE

We have migrated our codebase from Java EE (Enterprise Edition) to Jakarta EE, which brings various changes into Keycloak.
We have upgraded all Jakarta EE specifications in order to support Jakarta EE 10.
You can be affected by changing `javax.\*` to the `jakarta.*` namespace.

See the migration guide for more details.

= We upgraded to Quarkus 3!

We have upgraded the Quarkus Java framework, which lives underneath Keycloak and brings many benefits.
Quarkus 3 continues the tradition of propelling Java development by moving fast and providing a cutting-edge user experience with the latest technologies.
It continues to improve overall performance and efficiency.

Since Quarkus 3 is a major upgrade, some breaking changes were inevitable. See the migration guide for details.

= We use Hibernate ORM 6 now

Keycloak now benefits from the upgrade to Hibernate ORM 6.2, which includes improved performance, better SQL, modern JDK support, and support for modern RDBMS features.

If you have custom providers or JPA entities, these changes may affect you.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Legacy Promise API removed from Keycloak JS adapter

With this release, we have removed the legacy Promise API methods from the Keycloak JS adapter. This means that calling `.success()` and `.error()` on promises returned from the adapter is no longer possible.

= Keycloak JS adapter must be instantiated with the `new` operator

In a previous release we started to actively log deprecation warnings when the Keycloak JS adapter is constructed without the `new` operator. Starting this release doing so will throw an exception instead. This is to align with the expected behavior of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes[JavaScript classes], which will allow further refactoring of the adapter in the future.

= Export and Import perform an automatic build

In previous releases, the `export` and `import` commands required a `build` command to be run first.
Starting with this release, the `export` and `import` commands perform an automatic rebuild of Keycloak if a build time configuration has changed.

See the migration guide for more details.

= Renamed Keycloak Admin client artifacts

After the upgrade to Jakarta EE, artifacts for Keycloak Admin clients were renamed to more descriptive names with consideration for long-term maintainability.
We still provide two separate Keycloak Admin clients, one with Jakarta EE and the other with Java EE support.

See the migration guide for more details.
