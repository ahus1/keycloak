= Transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE

We have migrated our codebase from Java EE (Enterprise Edition) to Jakarta EE, which brings various changes into Keycloak.
Java EE was a widely adopted technology stack for developing enterprise applications in Java.
However, due to certain legal and licensing issues, Java EE was transferred to the Eclipse Foundation and renamed as Jakarta EE.

We have upgraded all Jakarta EE specifications in order to support Jakarta EE 10, such as:

* Jakarta Persistence 3.1
* Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.1
* Jakarta Mail API 2.1
* Jakarta Servlet 6.0
* Jakarta Activation 2.1
* Other

Jakarta EE 10 provides a modernized, simplified, lightweight approach to building cloud-native Java applications.
The main changes provided within this initiative are changing the namespace from `javax.\*` to `jakarta.*`.
It does not apply for `javax.*` packages provided directly in the JDK, such as `javax.security`, `javax.net`, `javax.crypto`, etc.

You can be affected by these changes in your custom extensions, providers or JPA entities.

== Deprecated Adapters stay on Java EE

As most of our OIDC and SAML client adapters are already deprecated, we will not upgrade them to support Jakarta EE.
However, client adapters with Java EE support can still communicate with the Keycloak server.

=  We have upgraded to Quarkus 3!

We have upgraded the Quarkus Java framework, which lives underneath Keycloak and brings many benefits.
Quarkus 3 continues the tradition of propelling Java development by moving fast and providing a cutting-edge user experience with the latest technologies.
It continues to improve overall performance and efficiency.

Quarkus 3 is based on Jakarta EE 10, the same as Keycloak, creating smooth interoperability between them.
In addition, it contains Eclipse MicroProfile 6, which aligns with Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile.
The central part of the Quarkus 3 upgrade is built-in support for JPA 3.1 and Hibernate ORM 6.

=== Stop using `quarkus.hibernate-orm.*` properties
For Quarkus 3, it is impossible to simultaneously specify Hibernate ORM properties for datasources via the `persistence.xml` file and Quarkus properties.
As for Keycloak, these properties are specified via the `persistence.xml` file, and it is required to specify the additional properties there.

= We use Hibernate ORM 6 now

Keycloak now benefits from the upgrade to Hibernate ORM 6.2, which includes improved performance, better SQL, modern JDK support, and support for modern RDBMS features.
The performance improvements primarily affect JDBC, HQL Translation, and Criteria Translation.

If you have custom providers or JPA entities, these changes may affect you.

We recommend reviewing the link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.0:-Hibernate-ORM-5-to-6-migration[Quarkus migration guide] or link:https://hibernate.org/orm/releases/[Hibernate release notes] for more information.

= Legacy Promise API removed from Keycloak JS adapter

The legacy Promise API methods have been removed from the Keycloak JS adapter. This means that calling `.success()` and `.error()` on promises returned from the adapter is no longer possible. Instead standardized Promise methods such as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then[`.then()`] and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch[`.catch()`] should be used.

[source, javascript]
.Before migration:
----
const keycloak = new Keycloak();

keycloak.init()
  .success(function(authenticated) {
    alert(authenticated ? 'authenticated' : 'not authenticated');
  }).error(function() {
    alert('failed to initialize');
  });
----

[source,javascript]
.After migration:
----
const keycloak = new Keycloak();

keycloak.init()
  .then(function(authenticated) {
    alert(authenticated ? 'authenticated' : 'not authenticated');
  }).catch(function() {
    alert('failed to initialize');
  });
----


[source,javascript]
.Or alternatively, when using the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await[`await`] keyword to unwrap these promises:
----
const keycloak = new Keycloak();

try {
  const authenticated = await keycloak.init();
  alert(authenticated ? 'authenticated' : 'not authenticated');
} catch (error) {
  alert('failed to initialize');
}
----

= Export and Import perform an automatic build

In previous releases, the `export` and `import` commands required a `build` command to be run first.
Starting with this release, the `export` and `import` commands perform an automatic rebuild of Keycloak if a build time configuration has changed.

When migrating existing scripts that run a `build` command first, migrate by adding the `--optimized` command line option to the `export` and `import` command to avoid Keycloak automatically re-building the image.
Not adding the `--optimized` option in this might make Keycloak trigger a rebuild and revert to the default values, and then connecting to the database for export and import will not work.

The following examples assume that runtime parameters like a database password are provided via a configuration file or an environment variable.

.Before migration: Running the build command before running the export command
[source,bash]
----
bin/kc.[sh|bat] build --db=postgres ...
bin/kc.[sh|bat] export --dir <dir>
----

.After migration: Adding `--optimized` to the export command
[source,bash,subs="+quotes"]
----
bin/kc.[sh|bat] build --db=postgres ...
bin/kc.[sh|bat] export ##--optimized## --dir <dir>
----

.After migration: Leveraging the auto-build functionality
[source,bash]
----
bin/kc.[sh|bat] export --dir <dir> --db=postgres ...
----

NOTE:: When the auto-build runs, the build time options will be in effect for all subsequent commands that are started with the `--optimized` flag, including the `start` command.

In previous releases the `export` and `import` commands allowed runtime parameters such as a database URL only in configuration files or environment variables.
Starting with this release, those runtime parameters are now available on the command line as well.
Use the `--help` option to find out about the supported parameters.

= Renamed Keycloak Admin client artifacts

After the upgrade to Jakarta EE, artifacts for Keycloak Admin clients were renamed to more descriptive names with consideration for long-term maintainability.
We still provide two separate Keycloak Admin clients, one with Jakarta EE and the other with Java EE support.

We stopped releasing the `org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-client-jakarta` artifact.
The default one for the Keycloak Admin client with Jakarta EE support is `org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-client` (since version 22.0.0).

We will continue to release the Keycloak Admin client with Java EE support for some time, but we recommend that you migrate to Jakarta EE as soon as possible.
The new artifact with Java EE support is `org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-client-jee`.
