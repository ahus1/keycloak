/**
 * This flags the session that all information loaded from the stores should be locked as the service layer
 * plans to modify it.
 *
 * This is just a hint to the underlying storage, and a store might choose to ignore it.
 * The lock for any object retrieved from the session will be kept until the end of the transaction.
 *
 * If the store supports it, this could prevent exceptions due to optimistic locking
 * problems later in the processing. If the caller retrieved objects without this wrapper, they would still be
 * able to modify those objects, and those changes would be written to the store at the end of the transaction at the lastet,
 * but they won't be locked.
